# PCI-DSS Automation Starter Pack üöÄ

## üìå What is PCI-DSS?

The **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)** is the global benchmark for protecting payment card data. It applies to any organization handling credit card information ‚Äî storing, processing, or transmitting.

It consists of **12 major requirements**, covering access control, authentication, logging, encryption, and vulnerability management.

---

## üí° Why does it matter?

PCI-DSS isn‚Äôt just bureaucracy ‚Äî it has real-world consequences:

* **Legal & contractual obligations:** Non-compliance can result in fines, lost merchant privileges, and higher transaction fees.
* **Security first:** Most PCI-DSS controls map to common attack vectors like weak passwords, unpatched software, or misconfigured services.
* **Operational hygiene:** PCI-DSS promotes continuous monitoring, auditing, and disciplined processes.

**Bottom line:** PCI-DSS compliance reduces risk and strengthens security posture.

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Approach

This project implements an **80/20 approach**, focusing on the **Top 10 most impactful, commonly overlooked PCI-DSS controls** for Windows 10:

* **Automation-first:** PowerShell scripts check, remediate, and confirm compliance.
* **Idempotent & safe:** Scripts can run multiple times without adverse effects.
* **Audit-friendly:** Each remediation outputs clear confirmation messages for compliance evidence.
* **Plug-and-play:** No system-specific modifications required; works on any Windows 10 machine.

---

## üîü The Top 10 Controls

1. **Password & Account Policy Enforcement** *(Req. 8.2, 8.3)*

   * Minimum 12-character passwords, max age 90 days, history 10.
   * Confirmation message at completion.

2. **Disable Local Administrator Account** *(Req. 2.2.4, 8.1.4)*

   * Reduces attack surface.
   * Automatic disable with confirmation.

3. **Disable Windows PowerShell 2.0**

   * Removes legacy vulnerable components.
   * Confirmation displayed after disabling.

4. **Remove Guest Account**

   * Prevents anonymous access.
   * Confirms whether Guest was disabled or already inactive.

5. **File Integrity Monitoring Baseline** *(Req. 11.5)*

   * Hashes and tracks critical system files.
   * Baseline hashes logged with confirmation.

6. **Disable LM & NTLMv1 Authentication**

   * Enforces secure authentication protocols.
   * Registry changes applied with confirmation.

7. **Disable Legacy SSL/TLS Protocols** *(Req. 4.1)*

   * Disables SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1.
   * Confirmation after all protocols disabled.

8. **Windows Defender Real-Time Protection**

   * Ensures anti-malware protection is enabled.
   * Confirmation provided; manual Tamper Protection verification noted.

9. **Account Lockout Policy Enforcement** *(Req. 8.1.6)*

   * Lockout threshold 10, duration 15 min, window 15 min.
   * Blank passwords disabled.
   * Confirmation logged at end.

10. **Audit Logging Enforcement** *(Req. 10.1‚Äì10.6)*

    * Enables logon/logoff and object access auditing.
    * Confirmation displayed; Security log retention requires manual verification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Scripts follow a **Check ‚Üí Remediate ‚Üí Confirm** model:

1. **Check:** Is the control already compliant?
2. **Remediate:** Apply the correct configuration.
3. **Confirm:** Log results in sequential confirmation messages.

All messages are displayed **together at the end** for easy review.

Example output:

```plaintext
1) Password policy enforced: Minimum 12 chars, max age 90 days, history 10.
2) Administrator account disabled.
3) Windows PowerShell 2.0 disabled.
...
10) Audit logging enabled for Logon/Logoff and Object Access.
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/pci-dss-powershell.git
cd pci-dss-powershell
```

2. Run the composite script:

```powershell
.\scripts\PCI-DSS-Top10-Remediation.ps1
```

3. Review the **sequential confirmation messages** at the bottom of the output.

## üìà Roadmap

* Add Linux / Unix equivalents (Bash / Ansible).
* Create Azure-native automation templates.
* Export audit-ready compliance reports (JSON/CSV).
* Integrate with SIEM/SOAR workflows.
