# PCI-DSS Automation Starter Pack üöÄ

[Composite Script Download](scripts/PCI-DSS_Top10-Remediation.ps1)

## üìå What is PCI-DSS?

The **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)** is the global benchmark for protecting payment card data. It applies to any organization handling credit card information ‚Äî storing, processing, or transmitting.

It consists of **12 major requirements**, covering access control, authentication, logging, encryption, and vulnerability management.

---

## üí° Why does it matter?

PCI-DSS isn‚Äôt just bureaucracy ‚Äî it has real-world consequences:

* **Legal & contractual obligations:** Non-compliance can result in fines, lost merchant privileges, and higher transaction fees.
* **Security first:** Most PCI-DSS controls map to common attack vectors like weak passwords, unpatched software, or misconfigured services.
* **Operational hygiene:** PCI-DSS promotes continuous monitoring, auditing, and disciplined processes.

**Bottom line:** PCI-DSS compliance reduces risk and strengthens security posture.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Approach

This project implements an **80/20 approach**, focusing on the **Top 10 most impactful, commonly overlooked PCI-DSS controls** for Windows 10:

* **Automation-first:** PowerShell scripts check, remediate, and confirm compliance.
* **Idempotent & safe:** Scripts can run multiple times without adverse effects.
* **Audit-friendly:** Each remediation outputs clear confirmation messages for compliance evidence.
* **Plug-and-play:** No system-specific modifications required; works on any Windows 10 machine.

   *PCI-DSS:* Req. 11.5 (File integrity monitoring)

6. **Disable LM & NTLMv1 Authentication**
   *Script:* `scripts/06-DisableLMNTLMv1.ps1` ‚Äî **Download**: [06-DisableLMNTLMv1.ps1](scripts/06-DisableLMNTLMv1.ps1)
   *What it does:* Sets registry to enforce LmCompatibilityLevel and disable NTLMv1.
   *PCI-DSS:* Req. 8.1, 2.2 (Authentication hardening / secure configuration)

7. **Disable Legacy SSL/TLS Protocols**
   *Script:* `scripts/07-DisableLegacyTLS.ps1` ‚Äî **Download**: [07-DisableLegacyTLS.ps1](scripts/07-DisableLegacyTLS.ps1)
   *What it does:* Disables SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 in SCHANNEL for client & server.
   *PCI-DSS:* Req. 4.1, 2.2.3 (Strong encryption in transit / secure configuration)

8. **Windows Defender Real-Time Protection**
   *Script:* `scripts/08-WDRealTime.ps1` ‚Äî **Download**: [08-WDRealTime.ps1](scripts/08-WDRealTime.ps1)
   *What it does:* Enables Windows Defender real-time scanning (Tamper Protection must be verified manually).
   *PCI-DSS:* Req. 5.1 (Anti-malware)

9. **Account Lockout Policy Enforcement**
   *Script:* `scripts/09-AccountLockout.ps1` ‚Äî **Download**: [09-AccountLockout.ps1](scripts/09-AccountLockout.ps1)
   *What it does:* Enforces lockout threshold (10), duration (15 min), observation window (15 min) and disables blank passwords.
   *PCI-DSS:* Req. 8.1.6 (Brute-force protection / account lockout)

10. **Audit Logging Enforcement**
    *Script:* `scripts/10-AuditLogging.ps1` ‚Äî **Download**: [10-AuditLogging.ps1](scripts/10-AuditLogging.ps1)
    *What it does:* Enables logon/logoff and object access auditing via `auditpol`.
    *PCI-DSS:* Req. 10.1‚Äì10.6 (Logging, monitoring, and retention)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Scripts follow a **Check ‚Üí Remediate ‚Üí Confirm** model:

1. **Check:** Is the control already compliant?
2. **Remediate:** Apply the correct configuration.
3. **Confirm:** Log results in sequential confirmation messages.

All messages are displayed **together at the end** for easy review.

Example output:

```plaintext
1) Password policy enforced: Minimum 12 chars, max age 90 days, history 10.
2) Administrator account disabled.
3) Windows PowerShell 2.0 disabled.
...
10) Audit logging enabled for Logon/Logoff and Object Access.
```
